## Technologies Used
- React
- JSX
- CSS / HTML
- React Router
- Cypress
- Dayjs

## Reflections
### Challenges
- Learning the ins and outs of React
- Learning 3 major new technologies at the same time (React, Router, Cypress)
- Building the project without Router and then having to refactor to implement Router
- Trying to add a sort by genre feature

### Wins
- Smooth workflow and collaboration 
- Once we learned more about Router, the refactor went smoothly
- We both learned a lot about React
- Had plenty of time to polish our project


## Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
